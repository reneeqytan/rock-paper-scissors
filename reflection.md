# reflection on rock paper scissors

## What was the most challenging part of this assignment?

I think figuring out how to get a random item from the choices array (rock, paper scissors) for the getComputerChoice() function was the most challenging.

I firstly had to use math.floor and math.random to get a random WHOLE number between 0 and 2. Then I used that number as the chosen index for the choices array.

## What was the most interesting thing you learned?

How to use math.floor and math.random to get a random number from an array

And the syntax for the for loop: initialisation, condition, increment

## What area would you like more practice with?

I think it'd be worth getting more practice with the math.floor and math.random functions.

Also I think it'd be good to get more practice with calling functions from within other functions.
